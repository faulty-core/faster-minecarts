## Faster Minecarts

Small mod that aims to balance the speed of vanilla minecarts compared to the other means of transportation available.

In Vanilla, the fastest horse can reach almost double the speed a vanilla minecart can while requiring close to no resources at the same time. This mod changes that
by increasing the speed of all vanilla minecarts from 8m/s to 32m/s. Additionally, minecarts will be slowed down automatically around corners to prevent them from derailing at those speeds.

This mod requires **Fabric**.
